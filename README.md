Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering entails analyzing user needs, preferences and pain points, and then designing, constructing and testing end-user applications that lead to user satisfaction by using software programming languages. Software engineering involves understanding and documenting the software’s requirements, creating intuitive designs and architecture, write codes and ensuring software quality through usability testing and quality assurance. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

During the SE Era 1 in 1956 to 1967, the term software engineering was not being used. Code development was strongly influenced by outside forces. The relevance of any software was optimizing usage of limited hardware resources. In SE era, the first compilers were defined but operating systems were non-interactive. Gradually. The primitive environments evolved into first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools (CASE tools) which improved interactive editing, compiling and debugging. 
The SE Era II in 1968 to 1982 led to software engineering after the first software crisis. Developers focused on reducing risks during development, enhancing quality and productivity. Software development methodologies aided in defining and monitoring software building. At this stage, developers embraced formal modelling approach that led to integration automation. 
The SE Era III in 1983 to 1992, helped in mastering the complexity of both hardware and software systems. Personal computers helped in enhancing productivity through various applications. For instance, the software development process focused on analysis and design from the specification. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning and Analysis Phase is the first stage where all stakeholders including the clients and the development team gather business requirements. The phase focuses on evaluating the feasibility of creating products and services, costs in production, potential needs revenue and users’ needs. 
Define Requirements entails using the data collected during planning and analysis stage in creating clear requirements for the development team. 
Design Phase focuses on understanding the application’s such as user interfaces, databases, system interfaces and network and network requirements. The team works collaboratively in formulating the plan and vision into a software design document and creates prototypes for stakeholders to understand the final products and also make changes. 
Development phase focuses on dividing the project into software modules and turning the software requirements into code that makes the product. The code program is built per the specifications of the design document. 
Testing phase focuses on making sure the product functions effectively and does what it is meant to do. It helps in identifying any security and user experience issues. Some type of testing that occur in this stage are performance, functional, unit, security, acceptance and usability testing. 
Implementation and Integration Phase focuses on combining different modules or designs and deploying the product to the end users. 
Finally, the maintenance phase involves continuous improvement of the system to ensure that it offers users intuitive experiences. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile methodologies is effective for dynamic teams that change teams members in different stages of the lifecycle or assign different responsibilities to team members whereas, waterfall methods works best for established teams, where every team member has a certain role and responsibility.  Agile methodology is best-suited for software development and general IT due to the iterative process and ever-changing responsibilities. Additionally, it can be used in advertising and marketing and aerospace companies. Waterfall methodology effectively works in manufacturing, construction and healthcare industries. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer is responsible for writing code and creating the entire software product. Additionally, the developer maintains and updates software, sends updates to the project manager and works closely with designers and QA team. Software developer position ranges from Front-end, back-end, full-stack and mobile developer 
Quality assurance engineers create and perform tests, identify errors and offer feedback to validate whether the final product meets the organization’s quality standards. 
Project manager roles include helping the team to design, execute, monitor and finish their work to provide clients with high quality software products. Other responsibilities include assembling and leading the development team, creating the blueprint of the project and allocation of resources, and communication.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs is a software application that helps software engineers develop code efficient as it enhances their productivity by integrating capabilities like software editing, building, testing and packaging in an to-use application. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio, WebStorm, PyCharm, PHPStorm and RubyMine.  On the hand, VCS such as Git, Helix core and Microsoft TFS are important tools for tracking changes to the codebase in a software product and is tailored to manage multiple file versions. VCS enhance collaboration, maintains clean code and fix mistakes. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Lack of predictability in software delivery as the requirements may change constantly which results in scope creep and an exponential project budget increase, bugs can increase at a high rate and infest the code which messes up the user experience. Improving the challenge entails minimizing external predictability, specifically avoiding getting locked in the cloud, making the SDLC process robust through code review, quality and performance analysis and testing. 
Scalability, security and performance challenges. Developers have different expertise and coding style for instance some do not comment on their codes whereas others comment excessively. Generally, the quality of code differs especially if an organization has no defined benchmarks. In this case, it is important to define coding standards to write scalable code, adopt tools like SonarQube, which empower development teams to perform code quality review and integrate infrastructure for observability and monitoring tools to improve performance. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests comprising of testing individual methods and function of the classes, modules and components are low level and close to the source of an application. 
Integration tests help in validating different modules and services incorporated by applications. For instance, testing the interaction between databases or making sure that microservices work collaboratively as required. 
Acceptance testing uses formal tests that verify whether the system satisfies the business needs. It entails running the entire application while testing and focusing on understanding and replicating user behavior. 
System testing runs tests on the final software product in relation to computer systems and ensures that products work effectively with software and hardware systems. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is an artificial intelligence (AI) technique that refines large language models (LLMs) with certain prompts and recommended outputs. It also focuses on refining input to various generative AI services to generate text or images. Generally, it is equivalent to teaching a child through well-phrased questions that guide their thought process.  Prompt engineering reduces the gap between effective human-AI communication and ensures AI understands the context, nuances and the intent behind every query. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt: “Tell me about JavaScript” 
An Improved Version: “Explain the role of JavaScript in web development, focusing on its use in front-end frameworks such as React and Vue, with examples of ways it improves user experience.” 
The second prompt is improved and more effective as it provides clarity, specificity and conciseness.
